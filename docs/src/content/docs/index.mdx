title: Getting Started
description: RealTimeX CRM is designed to be easy to customize and extend by developers with basic React and SQL skills.
---

RealTimeX CRM is a full-featured, open-source CRM built with React, Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase. It allows you to "Bring Your Own Database," giving you full control over your customer data.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 22 recommended)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required for local Supabase)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for production deployment

## Installation

### Option 1: Using the CLI (Recommended)

The fastest way to start a new RealTimeX CRM project is using our CLI:

```bash
npx create-realtimex-crm@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through:
1. Choosing a template (standalone app, RealTimeX Local App, or component)
2. Configuring Supabase (optional)
3. Setting up your project structure

Then simply run:
```bash
cd my-crm
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Fork the [RealTimeX CRM repository](https://github.com/therealtimex/realtimex-crm) on GitHub to your own account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[username]/realtimex-crm.git
    cd realtimex-crm
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

## Running Locally

1. Start the stack (Supabase + Vite dev server):

    ```bash
    make start
    ```

RealTimeX CRM now runs at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## "Bring Your Own Database" Setup

When you first launch RealTimeX CRM, you'll see a Setup Wizard. This allows you to connect the CRM to any Supabase project by simply entering your URL and API key.

![RealTimeX CRM Setup Wizard](../images/setup-wizard.png)

:::tip
If you prefer using environment variables, you can set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env` file. UI configuration takes precedence over environment variables.
:::

## Admin User Setup

After configuring your database, you will be prompted to create the first admin user. This user will have full access to the application and can manage other users.

Once the admin user is created, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

## Bootstrapping with Sample Data

It's easier to develop with an existing dataset. RealTimeX CRM provides a sample dataset you can import. Click the **Import** button in the Contacts list and choose `test-data/contacts.csv`. This will add contacts and companies to your local database.

## Configuring the Application

The entry point of the application is the `src/App.tsx` file. It renders the `<CRM>` component, which accepts various props for customization.

```tsx
import { CRM } from "@/components/atomic-crm/root/CRM";

const App = () => (
    <CRM 
        title="My Custom CRM"
        taskTypes={['Call', 'Email', 'Meeting', 'Demo']}
    />
);

export default App;
```

Check the [Customizing RealTimeX CRM](./developers/customizing) guide for an exhaustive list of configuration settings.

## Adding Custom Fields

You can extend the data model of RealTimeX CRM by adding custom fields to the existing entities (Contacts, Companies, Deals, Notes, and Tasks).

You will do so in the Supabase Studio. To access the Studio, go to [http://localhost:54323/](http://localhost:54323/).

![Supabase Studio](../images/supabase-studio.png)

We're going to add a custom field to the Contacts table: a "Referred By" text field to store the name of the person who referred the contact.

1. Click on the Database menu
2. Choose the Tables section in the Database management panel. You will see the list of tables used by RealTimeX CRM.
3. Click on the `contacts` table in the list of tables.
4. Click on the "New Column" button to add a new column to the table.

    ![Supabase Tables](../images/supabase-tables.png)

5. In the "Add new column to contacts" dialog, enter the following details:
    - Name: `referred_by`
    - Type: `text`
    - Default value: leave empty
    - Allow Nullable: checked
6. Finally, click on the "Save" button to add the new column to the table.

    ![Supabase New Column](../images/supabase-new-column.png)

RealTimeX CRM uses views to simplify the queries. You need to update the `contacts_summary` view to include the new `referred_by` field.

1. Click on the "SQL Editor" menu in the left sidebar.
2. Enter the following SQL query to update the `contacts_summary` view:

    ```sql
    drop view "public"."contacts_summary";
    create view "public"."contacts_summary"
        with (security_invoker=on)
        as
    select
        co.*,
        c.name as company_name,
        count(distinct t.id) as nb_tasks
    from
        "public"."contacts" co
    left join
        "public"."tasks" t on co.id = t.contact_id
    left join
        "public"."companies" c on co.company_id = c.id
    group by
        co.id, c.name;
    ```

    ![Supabase SQL Editor](../images/supabase-sql-editor.png)

3. Click on the "Run" button to execute the SQL command. You will need to confirm the action since it will drop and recreate the view.

4. Create a migration for these schema changes, to allow them to be replicated in production. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    npx supabase db diff -f create_referred_by
    ```

    This will create a new migration file in the `supabase/migrations` folder. Supabase will automatically apply this migration when you deploy to production.

That's it! You've just added a custom field to the Contacts entity. Supabase automatically updates the API to include the new field.

## Displaying Custom Fields in the Frontend

Next, you need to make this new field available in the frontend.

The frontend code lives in the `src/components/atomic-crm` folder, and is organized by entities. Each entity has its own folder containing all the components related to that entity. Take a few minutes to explore the codebase and familiarize yourself with its structure.

:::tip
RealTimeX CRM leverages two libraries that provided high-level building blocks: [Shadcn Admin Kit](https://marmelab.com/shadcn-admin-kit/) for the application logic, and [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the UI components. The code for these libraries is copied in the `src/components` folder.
:::

RealTimeX CRM uses TypeScript to ensure type safety, so you'll need to modify the `Contact` type to include the new `referred_by` field. Open the `src/components/atomic-crm/types.ts` file and add the `referred_by` field to the `Contact` interface.

```tsx {18}
export type Contact = {
  first_name: string;
  last_name: string;
  title: string;
  company_id: Identifier;
  email_jsonb: EmailAndType[];
  avatar?: Partial<RAFile>;
  linkedin_url?: string | null;
  first_seen: string;
  last_seen: string;
  has_newsletter: boolean;
  tags: Identifier[];
  gender: string;
  sales_id: Identifier;
  status: string;
  background: string;
  phone_jsonb: PhoneNumberAndType[];
  referred_by?: string;
  nb_tasks?: number;
  company_name?: string;
} & Pick<RaRecord, "id">;
```

You will modify the contact creation and edition form to include an input for the `referred_by` field.
To do so, open the `src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/ContactInputs.tsx` file to edit the `<ContactInputs>` component and add a new `<TextInput>`.

```tsx {5-8}
const ContactMiscInputs = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Misc</h6>
      <TextInput
        source="referred_by"
        helperText={false}
      />
      <TextInput
        source="background"
        label="Background info (bio, how you met, etc)"
        multiline
        helperText={false}
      />
      <BooleanInput source="has_newsletter" helperText={false} />
      <ReferenceInput
        reference="sales"
        source="sales_id"
        sort={{ field: "last_name", order: "ASC" }}
        filter={{
          "disabled@neq": true,
        }}
      >
        <SelectInput
          helperText={false}
          label="Account manager"
          optionText={saleOptionRenderer}
          validate={required()}
        />
      </ReferenceInput>
    </div>
  );
};
```

`<TextInput>` is a Shadcn Admin Kit component that binds a form field to the form state. Upon submission, the form data will include the `referred_by` field and the Supabase API will store it in the database.

The application will automatically pick up this code change. Go back to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and you can now create or edit a contact and set the "Referred By" field.

![Referred By in Contact Form](../images/contact-inputs-referred-by.png)

Finally, update the Contacts sidebar to display the referrer when available. Open the `src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/ContactAside.tsx` file and add a new `<TextField>` for the `referred_by` field.

```tsx {4-11}
export const ContactAside = ({ link = "edit" }: { link?: "edit" | "show" }) => {
    // ...
      <AsideSection title="Background info">
        {record.referred_by && (
          <div className="pb-2">
            <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mr-1">
              Referred by
            </span>
            <TextField source="referred_by" />
          </div>
        )}
        <WithRecord<Contact>
          render={(record) =>
            record?.background ? (
              <TextField source="background" record={record} className="pb-2" />
            ) : null
          }
        />
        // ...
};
```

This will display the "Referred By" information in the contact sidebar when available.

## Deploying to Production

It's time to deploy your customized version of RealTimeX CRM to production. You use [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com) to host the backend, and GitHub Pages to host the frontend. Both services offer free plans that are sufficient for RealTimeX CRM.

First, login or register to [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

RealTimeX CRM comes with a CLI utility to create a backend instance on Supabase.com:

```sh
make supabase-remote-init
```

The script will ask you for the Supabase instance name, create the database, apply the migrations and deploy the edge functions. Finally, it will create a `.env.production.local` file with your remote Supabase configuration.

The frontend of the CRM is a Single-Page App that can be deployed to any CDN. Since you have forked the RealTimeX CRM repository on GitHub, you can use GitHub Pages to host the frontend.

First, build the frontend bundle with:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the built application made of static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

To deploy it to GitHub pages, use the following command:

```sh
npm run ghpages:deploy
```

After a couple minutes, your customized CRM will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/atomic-crm/`, and connected to the production Supabase instance you created earlier.

You can proceed with the creation of the first admin user and start using your CRM in production!

:::tip
Supabase.com and GitHub Pages are just two of the many services you can use to host your RealTimeX CRM. You can [self-host a supabase instace](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting), and use any static server or CDN (e.g. CloudFlare, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) to host the frontend.
