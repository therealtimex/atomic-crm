## Email (.EML) Preview

RealTimeX CRM features a professional email viewer for `.eml` files, perfect for reviewing captured communications.

### Features:
- **Header Info**: See From, To, CC, Subject, and Date at a glance.
- **Body Rendering**: View the email in its original HTML format or toggle to Plain Text.
- **Attachments**: View or download files embedded directly within the email file.
- **Security**: All HTML content is sanitized to protect you from malicious scripts.

## Advanced Previews

### Excel (XLSX)
The Excel viewer supports multi-sheet workbooks, allowing you to switch between tabs just like in a dedicated spreadsheet application.

### Word & PowerPoint
DOCX and PPTX files are rendered faithfully, maintaining their layout and formatting for quick reading.

## Usage

Anywhere an attachment is listed (e.g., in Notes or under a Contact's attachments), simply **click the filename** to open the viewer modal. You can close the modal with the Escape key or by clicking the close button.
