- Primary contact
- Related deal information
- Default currency and payment terms

The invoice editor allows you to add multiple line items with:

- Tax rates (including presets)
- Automatic total calculation

## Managing Invoice Status

Track the lifecycle of your invoices through various statuses:

- **Paid**: Recorded payment, including the payment date.
- **Overdue**: Automatically flagged based on the due date.
- **Cancelled**: For voided invoices.

## Dashboard Integration

The CRM dashboard includes two dedicated invoice widgets:
1. **Revenue Overview**: A bar chart showing paid vs. pending revenue over the last 6 months.
2. **Outstanding Invoices**: A prioritized list of overdue and pending high-value invoices.

## Exporting and Printing

- **Professional Print**: Use the **Print** action to generate a clean, professional document for your client. The interface automatically hides all UI elements to focus on the invoice content.
