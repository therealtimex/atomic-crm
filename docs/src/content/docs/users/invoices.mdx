RealTimeX CRM features a powerful Invoices module that allows you to create, manage, and track professional invoices linked to your companies, contacts, and deals.

## Overview

The Invoices module provides a complete workflow for your billing process, from template-based creation to PDF generation and email delivery.

## Configuring Your Brand

Before sending invoices, ensure your organization's identity is set up in **Settings > Organization**.

- **Branding**: Upload your company logo.
- **Organization Details**: Set your company name, address, and Tax ID.
- **Banking**: Add your bank details and payment instructions.
- **Email Settings**: Configure the "Sender Name" and "Sender Email" (e.g., `billing@yourcompany.com`) that will appear on outgoing emails.

All these details will automatically appear on your invoices and in email footers.

## Invoice Templates

Templates allow you to save reusable invoice structures to speed up your workflow.

### Creating a Template
1. Go to **Invoices > Templates**.
2. Click **Create Template**.
3. Define default values for:
   - **Line Items** (e.g., standard services or products)
   - **Notes** (e.g., "Thank you for your business")
   - **Payment Terms** (e.g., "Net 30")
   - **Due Days** (e.g., 14 days)

### Using a Template
When creating a new invoice, simply select a template from the dropdown. All predefined items, notes, and settings will be instantly applied, which you can then customize for the specific client.

## Creating an Invoice

You can create an invoice from the main Invoices list or directly from a Company, Contact, or Deal show page.

### Smart Context
When creating an invoice from a specific entity (e.g., a Deal), the CRM automatically pre-fills:
- Customer details (Company/Contact)
- Related deal information
- Primary recipient email

### Adding Line Items
The invoice editor allows you to add multiple line items with:
- Description and detailed notes
- Quantity and unit price
- Discount (Percentage or Fixed Amount)
- Tax rates (with quick presets like 0%, 10%, 20%)

## Sending Invoices via Email

Streamline client communication by emailing invoices directly from the CRM.

1. Open the invoice and click **Send Email**.
2. **Recipient Detection**: The system intelligently suggests the best email address (Contact's primary email or Company email).
3. **CC Support**: Add multiple CC recipients (e.g., `accounting@client.com`) if needed.
4. **Professional Delivery**: The email includes a branded summary and the invoice attached as a high-quality PDF.
5. **Status Update**: Upon sending, the invoice status is automatically updated to **Sent**.

## Managing Status & Payment

Track the lifecycle of your invoices through various statuses:
- **Draft**: Initial creation phase.
- **Sent**: Marked automatically when emailed or manually after delivery.
- **Paid**: use the **Mark as Paid** action to record the payment date.
- **Overdue**: Automatically flagged based on the due date.
- **Cancelled**: For voided invoices.

## Exporting & PDF

- **Download PDF**: Generate a high-fidelity, professional PDF including your branding, logo, and layout optimized for printing.
- **CSV Export**: Download a raw data file of your invoices for import into external accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).

## Dashboard Insights

The CRM dashboard includes two dedicated financial widgets:
1. **Revenue Overview**: A bar chart showing paid vs. pending revenue trends over the last 6 months.
2. **Outstanding Invoices**: A prioritized list of overdue and pending high-value invoices to help you chase payments.
