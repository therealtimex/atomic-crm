## Creating the First User

The first time you open the RealTimeX CRM App and connect your database, you will be prompted to create the first user. This user will automatically be granted the **Administrator** role.

## Authentication Methods

RealTimeX CRM supports multiple ways to log in:

### 1. Email and Password
The traditional way to log in. You'll set your password when your account is created or via a password reset link.

### 2. Email OTP (One-Time Password)
For improved security and reliability, you can log in using a 6-digit code sent to your email. This avoids issues with link expirations or corporate email filters that might block magic links.

## Adding Users

Administrators can create new users by navigating to **Settings > Users**. 

1. Click the **Create** button.
2. Enter the user's details (Name, Email).
3. Choose their role (User or Administrator).
4. The user will receive an invitation email to set their password.

## Disabling Users

To prevent a user from accessing the CRM without deleting their historical data (like notes and tasks they've created), you can **Disable** their account in the User Edit screen. Disabled users cannot log in, but their activities remain visible in the CRM.
