description: Learn how to add new languages and customize translations in RealTimeX CRM.
---

RealTimeX CRM uses **React-Admin's i18n system** powered by [Polyglot.js](https://airbnb.io/polyglot.js/) for internationalization.

## Current Setup

- **Supported Locales**: English (`en`), French (`fr`), Spanish (`es`), Vietnamese (`vi`), Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`)
- **i18n Provider**: `src/components/atomic-crm/root/i18nProvider.tsx`
- **Framework**: `ra-i18n-polyglot`
- **Translation Hook**: `useTranslate()` from `ra-core`
- **Language Switcher**: `LocalesMenuButton` component (appears in the header)
- **Locale Persistence**: Stored per user in `sales.locale`

## How to Add New Languages

### 1. Install Language Package

React-Admin provides official translation packages for many languages:

```bash
npm install ra-language-french  # French
npm install ra-language-german  # German
# See full list: https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Translation.html
```

### 2. Update i18nProvider

Edit `src/components/atomic-crm/root/i18nProvider.tsx` to include the new locale and its corresponding messages.

### 3. Add Custom Translations

If you have CRM-specific terms that aren't covered by the official packages, you can create custom translation files (e.g., `src/i18n/en.ts`) and merge them into the `i18nProvider`.

## Using Translations in Components

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { useTranslate } from "ra-core";

function MyComponent() {
  const translate = useTranslate();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{translate("crm.menu.dashboard")}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With Interpolation

```typescript
translate("ra.message.created", { name: "Contact" });
```

## Language Switcher

The language switcher automatically detects supported locales from your `i18nProvider`. When a user changes their language, it is immediately persisted to their profile in the database, ensuring their preference is remembered across devices.

## Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode user-facing text**: Always use translation keys.
2. **Namespace your keys**: Use prefixes like `crm.` to avoid collisions.
3. **Test with long strings**: Languages like French and German often have longer text than English, which can affect your layout.
