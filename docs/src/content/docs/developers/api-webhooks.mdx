title: API & Webhooks
description: Integrate RealTimeX CRM with your other tools using our REST API and Webhook system.
---

RealTimeX CRM is designed to be highly interoperable. You can interact with your CRM data programmatically via our REST API or receive real-time updates through Webhooks.

## API Keys

To use the API, you must first create an API key in the **Settings > Integrations** page.

- **Scopes**: When creating a key, you can define specific permissions (e.g., `contacts:read`, `deals:write`).
- **Security**: Your API key is only shown once. Store it securely. All requests use HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for security.

## REST API

Our REST API provides full CRUD operations for all major entities. The base URL is determined by your Supabase project.

### Endpoints
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/contacts`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/companies`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/deals`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/tasks`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /v1/invoices`
- `POST /v1/invoices/{id}/send`: Send an invoice by email.
- `POST /v1/activities`: Create notes and tasks in a single request.

For the full specification, including request/response examples and error codes, please refer to the [API.md](https://github.com/therealtimex/realtimex-crm/blob/main/docs/API.md) file in the repository.

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow RealTimeX CRM to notify your external services when specific events occur.

### Supported Events
- **CRUD Events**: `contact.created`, `company.updated`, `invoice.deleted`, etc.
- **Business Events**: `deal.won`, `deal.lost`, `task.completed`, `invoice.sent`, `invoice.status_changed`.

### Configuration
1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**.
2. Enter your destination URL.
3. Select the events you want to subscribe to.
4. (Optional) Define a secret key to verify the payload signature (`X-Hook-Signature`).

### Delivery & Retries
Webhooks are delivered asynchronously. If your server is down, the system will retry delivery with exponential backoff to ensure you don't miss important updates.

## Rate Limiting

By default, the API is rate-limited to **100 requests per minute** per API key to ensure stability. Standard rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`) are included in every response.
