### 2. Share Feedback
As a newly launched project, your feedback is our most valuable asset. Please open an issue for:
- 🐛 Bug reports
- ✨ Feature requests
- 💡 UI/UX suggestions

### 3. Contribute Code
Check out our `CONTRIBUTING.md` (coming soon) to see how you can help. We follow a "Mutable Dependency" pattern where we encourage you to customize the UI and Admin kit components directly.

## Our Philosophy
We believe that CRM software should be **transparent**, **portable**, and **private**. By allowing you to "Bring Your Own Database" via Supabase, we ensure you never lose access to your most important asset: your customer relationships.

Let's build the future of CRMs together! 🚀
