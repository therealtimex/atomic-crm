## [0.46.10] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Core**: Resolved 401 Unauthorized errors when creating users or performing administrative actions by adding missing Edge Functions (`users`, `updatePassword`, `mergeContacts`, `mergeCompanies`, `postmark`) to `supabase/config.toml` with `verify_jwt = false`. These functions manage their own authentication internally.

## [0.46.9] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Localization**: Resolved an issue where migration banner and modal strings appeared as raw translation keys (e.g., `crm.migration.banner.title`) by moving the translation context provider to the root `App` component.

## [0.46.8] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Deployment**: Corrected relative paths for email templates in `supabase/config.toml` to be relative to the project root (adding the `supabase/` prefix). This fixes the "no such file or directory" error during migration.

## [0.46.7] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Deployment**: Corrected relative paths for email templates in `supabase/config.toml`. Previously, the paths were incorrectly nested, causing `supabase config push` to skip template synchronization.

## [0.46.5] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Deployment**: Correctly configured email templates in `supabase/config.toml` to ensure they are synchronized during `supabase config push`. This fixes an issue where default Supabase templates were still being used after migration.

## [0.46.4] - 2026-01-05

### Changed

- **Deployment**: Updated `scripts/migrate.sh` to include `supabase config push`, automating the synchronization of project configuration (Auth, Storage, etc.) during deployment.

### Added

- **Automation**: New `npm run supabase:configure:project` script to automatically set up auth settings (OTP, email templates) via Supabase Management API.
- **Templates**: Added branded email templates for `invite`, `confirmation`, `magic-link`, `recovery`, and `email-change` actions.
- **Configuration**: Added `verify_jwt = false` to `supabase/config.toml` for public edge functions, removing the need for manual deploy flags.

### Changed

- **Branding**: Comprehensive rebranding from "Atomic CRM" to "RealTimeX CRM" across all email templates, code comments, and documentation.
- **Deployment**: Simplified `scripts/migrate.sh` to leverage `supabase/config.toml` settings instead of hardcoded flags.

### Fixed

- **Build**: Removed unused `visualizer` variable in `vite.demo.config.ts` that was preventing successful publishing.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Localization**: Fixed an issue where the "Checking database connection..." message (crm.root.database_checking) was displayed as a raw translation key during app startup by wrapping the health check component with the i18n context provider.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **Search**: Implemented smart multi-word full-text search for companies and contacts. This allows order-independent matching (e.g., "Le Dang" matches "Trung Le" + "Dang Corp").

### Fixed

- **Search**: Normalized special characters (e.g., non-breaking hyphens, en-dashes) in search text to ensure consistent matching against standard ASCII characters.

## [0.45.11] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- **Localization**: Translated hardcoded "last activity", "at", and task count strings in the contact list and related components.

## [0.44.3] - 2026-01-04

## [0.44.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.44.1] - 2026-01-04

## [0.44.0] - 2026-01-04

## [0.43.3] - 2026-01-04

## [0.43.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.43.1] - 2026-01-04

## [0.43.0] - 2026-01-04

## [0.40.7] - 2026-01-01

### Changed

- **Database**: Changed task `due_date` and `done_date` columns from `timestamp with time zone` to `date` type.
  - **ROOT CAUSE FIX**: Prevents timezone conversion issues for date-only values
  - User selects "Dec 31, 2025" → saves as "2025-12-31" (not "2026-01-01T08:00:00Z")
  - No time or timezone components stored, just the calendar date
  - Migration automatically drops and recreates dependent views (tasks_summary, contacts_summary, companies_summary)
  - Migration extracts date part from existing timestamps (safe conversion)
  - **BREAKING**: If you have custom code relying on time/timezone in these fields, it will need updating
- **Tasks**: Updated completed tasks filter logic to work with date-only values.
  - Changed from "completed in last 5 minutes" to "completed today"
  - Shows tasks completed today in the task list (previously tried to compare date with timestamp)

### Fixed

- **Tasks**: Fixed task edit dialog triggering unwanted navigation to detail page when clicking date picker in task list table.
  - Moved TaskEdit dialog rendering outside of table row context to prevent event bubbling
  - Edit dialog now renders at TaskListTable component level instead of inside TaskActions
  - Clicking on date picker or other form elements no longer triggers row click navigation
  - Issue only affected task list table; sidebar edit was unaffected
- **Tasks**: Fixed timezone bug causing due dates to display 1 day earlier than saved value.
  - Date-only strings (YYYY-MM-DD) now parsed as local dates instead of UTC to prevent timezone shift
  - Example: Setting "Jan 15, 2027" now correctly displays as "Jan 15, 2027" instead of "Jan 14, 2027"
  - Fixed in both task list table and task detail page for consistent date display
  - Affects all date parsing including relative dates, formatted dates, and date calculations
- **Tasks**: Improved due date labels for future tasks - all future dates now show "Due in X days" format.
  - Changed from showing formatted date (e.g., "Jan 15, 2027") for dates beyond 7 days
  - Consistent "Due in X days" format makes it easier to scan and prioritize tasks
  - Completed tasks still show formatted dates

## [0.40.6] - 2025-12-31

### Changed

- **Deals**: Converted deal detail view from dialog to full-page layout with sidebar.
  - Consistent UX pattern matching Contacts and Tasks detail pages

### Fixed

- **Tasks**: Fixed task type icon alignment in task list - icons now vertically center with task titles even when text wraps to multiple lines.
- **UI**: Fixed checkbox vertical alignment in all data tables - checkboxes now properly center within table rows by matching cell padding and using flex container with full height.

## [0.40.4] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- **Notes**: Fixed error when adding notes to tasks by only updating `last_seen` column for resources that have it (contacts, companies), not for tasks or deals.
- **Notes**: Unified timestamp system - all notes (UI-created and automated) now use simple server-based UTC timestamps (`new Date().toISOString()`) instead of complex client-side timezone conversions, ensuring single source of truth and avoiding issues with incorrect client machine time.

## [0.40.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- **Tasks**: Synchronized task note timestamps by relying on server-side generation instead of client-side dates, ensuring consistency between UI and API actions.

## [0.40.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- **Tasks**: Robust parsing of `due_date` to handle both date-only strings and full ISO 8601 timestamps, preventing "Invalid Date" errors and timezone shifts during snooze/postpone actions.

## [0.40.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Tasks**: Automatic audit trail for quick actions with taskNotes integration.
  - Mark complete action creates note: "Task marked as complete via quick action"

  - Intelligent logic prevents confusing UX (e.g., "snoozing" a task already due next week)
  - Available in both task list table and detail page sidebar
  - Audit trail notes reflect actual action taken ("snoozed" vs "postponed")
  - Tooltip labels update dynamically based on task due date context

## [0.38.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Tasks**: Active filter bar with removable chips for clear filter visibility.
  - Displays all active filters as badge chips above the task list
  - User-friendly labels (e.g., "My Tasks", "Contact: John Doe", "Status: Done")
  - One-click removal via X button on each chip
  - Automatically fetches and displays names for Contact, Company, and Deal filters
  - Hides when no filters are active (no visual clutter)
  - Excludes default filters (e.g., archived: false) from display
  - Supports all filter types: search, select, reference, boolean, custom
  - Updates list immediately when filters are removed
